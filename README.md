# Behavioral-Cloning
Udacity SDC Project 4

This is a series of model developed in Keras as the main deliverable for the Udacity Self-driving car Engineering 
Nanodegree (Term 1).  The project is designed to teach aspects of behavioral cloning, where a machine learning-
computer vison algorithm is trained to mimic the user's behavior on the Udacity SDC behavioral simulator.

The code is written in Python 3 and Keras.

Several models are generated; however, the best current version is model.h5.  The script to develop the model is model.py.

The data generator and augmentation iterator is generate_data.py.
